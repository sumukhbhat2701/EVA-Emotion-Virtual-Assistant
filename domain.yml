  utter_faq_vulnerable:
  - text: All age groups and all category of people can catch COVID-19. While we are
      still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons (over 60 years)
      and persons with pre-existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure,
      heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes etc, appear to develop serious
      illness more often than others and maybe put on ventillators to counter their
      breathing problems.Please take your vaccinations/medications for diseases you
      already have as regularly.In experimental conditions, both cats and dogs and
      other pets/animals were able to transmit infection to other animals of the same
      species. However, there is no evidence that these animals can transmit the disease
      onto humans and spread COVID-19 directly or through their faeces. However, it
      may happen on contact.Please get tested as soon as possible when suspected,
      irrelevent of you age.
  utter_faq_testing:
  - text: There are many tests like RDT,ELISA,Neutralization assay,antogen tests,Chemiluminescent
      immunoassay etc. The most common is the RDT(Rapid diagnotic tests) where they
      use a small, portable, positive/negative lateral flow assay that can be executed
      at point of care. RDTs may process blood samples, saliva samples, or nasal swab
      fluids. RDTs produce colored lines to indicate positive or negative results.
      If you suspect that you may have the symptoms of COVID-19 or you were in contact
      with the infected, you can take the test fearlessly as it has no harm and precautions
      at the earliest may lead for early recovery.Don't panic, be the courage to be
      positive in the mindset!
  utter_faq_supply:

      no need to panic and buy more stuffs.Just keep calm and follow the following:
      When shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching
      your eyes, mouth and nose. Once home, wash your hands thoroughly and also after
      handling and storing your purchased products.Wash the fruits and vegetables
      the same way you should do under any circumstance: before handling them,wash
      your hands with soap and water.'
  utter_faq_masks:
  - text: Wearing a mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases,
      including COVID-19.Medical masks to be worn by medical faculties involved in
      the treatment of COVID-19 infected and the general public can make use of general
      non-medical masks.They have to disposed properly and seperated from general
      waste after use(do no touch the front, remove by pulling the elastic ear straps
      or laces from behind).Although their protective effectiveness to the wearer
      is unknown, they may protect others if the wearer is a pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic
      carrier. However, there are several case studies indicate that they reduce the
      risk of infection.So it recommended to wear a mask while stepping out of the
      house.No need to wear them inside your houses if there are no symptoms of the
      same.
  utter_faq_timescale:
  - text: It was noticed that one third of the coronavirus sample mutated on experimental
      conditions.Seasons or weather has no effect on the spread of COVID-19. It is
      necessary to take equal precautions in all the seasons.There is no way to tell
      when the epidemic will end.Predictions can be made using some mathematical modelling,
      which may or may not be accurate results.The number of cases will gradually
      decrease when hit its peak.More the people become aware and take precautions,
      sooner there are chances for the epidemic to end! So, no need to fear.Follow
      social distancing,wear masks,use sanitizers regularly and all the suggested
      methods.You can refer to our prediction model which can give you an estimate
      for the COVID-19 infection count.Again,it is subject to change!
  utter_faq_handwashing:
  - text: 'Clean your hands regularly and thorughly on all sides.Wash your hands with
      soap and water, and dry them thoroughly.Use alcohol-based handrub/sanitizers
      if you don‚Äôt have immediate access to soap and water.This decreases the risk
      of infection.In non-health care settings like supermarkets,grocery shops etc,
      sodium hypochlorite (bleach / chlorine) maybe used at a recommended concentration
      of 0.1% or 1,000ppm (1 part of 5% strength household bleach to 49 parts of water).
      Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for surface disinfection.Studies have shown
      that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless
      steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.There‚Äôs
      no research yet on exactly how long the virus can live on your skin or hair. '
  utter_faq_whatisit:
  - text: Novel CoronaVirus(nCOV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been
      previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses
      that are known to cause illness in humans and animals. In humans, this large
      family of viruses are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).COVID-19 is the infectious disease
      caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.nCOV directly effects the
      respiratory organs and multiplies there.COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted
      between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.There are no
      conclusive evidences that it spreads through air. Mild symptoms include breathing
      disorder,fever,dry cough,tiredness for 5-6 days and also maybe be severe as
      death. Many cases are also asymptomatic or with no symptoms which is a case
      of concern.
  utter_faq_origin:
  - text: It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity
      to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. There is
      no evidence yet to link an intermediate animal reservoir, such as a pangolin,
      to its introduction to humans.The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China,
      in December 2019. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public
      Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11
      March.

      effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by WHO and partners. It is hoped
      that one or more of the treatments under trial will result in improving clinical
      outcomes in COVID-19 patients and save lives. Other trials are on-going around
      the world in addition to the Solidarity Trial. Based on data from laboratory
      and clinical studies, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir with
      Interferon beta-1a, and hydroxychloroquine had been initially selected as treatment
      options. Following new evidence on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine
      as a treatment for hospitalized  COVID-19 patients, enrollment for this drug
      was temporarily suspended on 24 May 2020.

  - text: Seek medical care, if you or the people you know like your members of your
      family get seriously ill.If possible,either you or an adult should phone the
      local or national COVID-19 emergency number for advice on where and how you
      could get care. If mild-symptoms are seen, one can be self-isolated(self-quarantine)
      and symptoms can be kept track of.Unless the case is serious or it is a child
      or an old-aged person, seek help immediately!Always wear mask,keep 1m distance
      and avoid touching surfaces while visiting a health-case facility.
  utter_faq_gloves:
  - text: The use of gloves by the public in public spaces is not a recommended or
      proven prevention measure.People can also transfer pathogens from one surface
      to another by touching with gloved hands, or even transfer pathogens to the
      mouth, nose, or eyes if they touch their face with gloved hands.But hand hygiene
      is the key!
  utter_on_pregnancy_and_childbirth:
  - text: There is no evidence that pregnant are at higher risk of severe illness
      than the general population.They can't passon their infection to their unborn
      baby. But it may happen on contact when born.Pregnant women and women who have
      recently delivered ‚Äì including those affected by COVID-19 - should attend their
      routine care appointments. WHO recommendations are that pregnant women with
      symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing.To date, the active virus
      has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk.WHO advice is
      that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically justified.Hands
      should be washed properly before and after touching your baby, and keep all
      surfaces clean!Pregnant women should be taken care in the same way as any other
      individuals and should be kept away from the crowd as much as possible.
  utter_on_mass_gathering:
  - text: An event counts as a ‚Äúmass gathering‚Äù if the number of people it brings
      together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response
      resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need
      to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of
      participants. It is WHO‚Äôs view that all countries with community transmission
      should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings.Promote hand
      washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you
      have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are
      staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information
      will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact
      tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19.
  utter_on_mass_gathering1:
  - text: The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one
      or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include
      rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health
      facility.Temperature screening can be done but it is more effective to provide
      prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations
      at arrival, with travellers‚Äô contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment
      and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers.Establish close collaboration
      with local public health authorities well before the event, to facilitate testing
      for athletes, officials or spectators who meet pre-agreed suspect cases definitions.
      Also promote:signage, digital messaging to all participants and their entourages
      about COVID-19 and how to prevent infectionregular disinfection and cleaning
      of surfaces, in venues and in personal spaces non-sharing of equipment and cleaning
      of equipment after each user.

      fluids. However, having sex with someone means that you are very close to them.
      This puts one person at risk if the other person has COVID-19. Masturbation
      does not involve another person, and carries no risk of COVID-19.In 2019, WHO

  utter_on_healthcareworkers9:
  - text: Ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients
      should be isolated in single rooms. However, when this is not feasible (e.g.,
      limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. Some patients
      with suspected 2019-nCoV infection may actually have other respiratory illnesses,
      hence they must be cohorted separately from patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV
      infection. A minimum of 1-meter distance between beds should be maintained at

      protection (e.g.,goggles, face shield), before entering the room where suspected
      or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients are admitted. Respirators
      (e.g. N95) are only required for aerosol generating procedures.Tests in the

  utter_on_resources:
  - text: Health care workers and officers in covid 19 duty and first responders can
      justifiably be prioritized. Their health helps preserve the health of others.Participants
      of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical resources
      should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they havealso
      helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority
      ‚Äì for example, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most
      at risk in thecase of resources such as vaccines.
  utter_on_resources1:
  - text: While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating
      resources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency.
      In practice,it is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest
      to a distribution centre,those with access to better information, or those who
      are most well-off.Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19
      context.Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority
      for vaccine, but perhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need
      critical careresources.
  utter_on_resources2:
  - text: The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in
      different principles or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to
      be safe and effective, a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those
      as highest risk, the old andthose with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available
      vaccines.Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority
      to the worst-off:centralizing the availability of resources in larger centres
      may extend their benefits to more people, but may exclude isolated populations
      and challenge our concern for those at highest risk.

      in parks or public places always practice physical distancing and wash your
      hands with water and soap or hand sanitizers before you leave, when you get
      to where you are going, and as soon as you get home and maintain physical distancing.
      If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities,
      like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10
      minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few
      weeks.Choose the right activity according to your health status and fitness
      level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while

      break either by yourself, by joining an online class, or by setting up a time
      to be active online with your friends or colleagues.Planning time to be active
      with your children with active games at home, walks in the parks, or cycling
      can be a way the whole family can relax, be together and be active and healthy
      whilst at home.Do some muscle strengthening activities such as lifting weights
      or improvise using full bottles of water or simply use your own body weight
      and do sets of press ups, sit ups and squats. Make time for fun, such as dancing
      to music.

      the health and education policy-makers, teachers and other school staff, parents
      and health and community workers., with all necessary measures in place to protect
      the safety and health of everyone in the school community.Therefore,if your
      school reopens, you should feel assured it is safe for you to go back to school
      ‚Äì provided that you strictly follow the guidelines and rules that will be provided
      by your school. Of course, if you have any concerns with going back to school,
      do not hesitate to speak out to your teachers and parents or guardians.Online
      classes are always an alternative.

      - are worrying about security, health, and money. When people are in the cramped
      and confined living conditions of lockdown, these tensions and stress can become
      even greater. It is normal to have disagreements. However, if the disagreements
      become verbal or physical, then it is right to take action.Talk to your parents
      or if you are worried about what is happening in your home, or don‚Äôt feel safe,
      talk to a trusted adult about what worries you, and seek their advice.If you
      have been sexually abused or raped and need urgent medical help or care, go
      as soon as possible to the nearest hospital or clinic to ask for medical care.Read

      be spending even more hours online than before. Try to limit the amount of screen
      time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. It is important
      to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities,
      like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity,
      like  going for a walk or jog. Excessive gaming can lead to ‚Äúg aming disorder‚Äù
      that leads to reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression,
      headaches, and attention problems.Beware of behaviours like sextual exploitation,blackmail,harassment
      and bullying.Indulgement in such behaviour is a punishable crime as well.Refer

  - text: Explain to your friends why it is important to protect themselves and others
      by washing their hands, avoiding touching their face, always coughing or sneezing
      into their elbow, sleeve, or a tissue, and cooperating with physical distancing
      measures and movement restrictions when called on to do so. Maybe you can share
      ideas for fun virtual activities that your friends can participate in,  and
      you can encourage them to do them together with you or with other friends. But,
      remember that you do not have control over other peoples‚Äô actions so do not
      get into an argument or a fight to try to change their minds.
