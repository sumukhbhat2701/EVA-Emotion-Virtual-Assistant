#  nlu_threshold: minimum threshold for NLU confidence.
#           If intent prediction confidence is lower than this,
#           predict fallback action with confidence 1.0.
#       core_threshold: if NLU confidence threshold is met,
#           predict fallback action with confidence
#           `core_threshold`. If this is the highest confidence in
#           the ensemble, the fallback action will be executed.
#       fallback_core_action_name: This action is executed if the Core
#           threshold is not met.
#       fallback_nlu_action_name: This action is executed if the user
#           denies the recognised intent for the second time.
#       deny_suggestion_intent_name: The name of the intent which is used
#            to detect that the user denies the suggested intents.
